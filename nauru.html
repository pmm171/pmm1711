        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <h3>Background</h3>

        <p>Nauru was inhabited by Micronesian and Polynesian settlers by around <time datetime="1000">1000</time> <abbr title="Before Christ">B.C.</abbr>, and the island was divided into 12 clans. Nauru developed in relative isolation because ocean currents made landfall on the island difficult. As a result, the Nauruan language does not clearly resemble any other in the Pacific region.</p>

        <p>In <time datetime="1798">1798</time>, British sea captain John FEARN became the first European to spot the island. By <time datetime="1830">1830</time>, European whalers used Nauru as a supply stop, trading firearms for food. In <time datetime="1878">1878</time>, a civil war erupted on the island, reducing the population by more than a third.</p>

        <p>Germany forcibly annexed Nauru in <time datetime="1888">1888</time> by holding the 12 chiefs under house arrest until they consented to the annexation. Germany banned alcohol, confiscated weapons, instituted strict dress codes, and brought in Christian missionaries to convert the population. Phosphate was discovered in 1900 and heavily mined, although Nauru and Nauruans earned about one tenth of one percent of the profits from the phosphate deposits.</p>

        <p>Australian forces captured Nauru from Germany during World War I, and in <time datetime="1919">1919</time>, it was placed under a joint Australian-British-New Zealand mandate with Australian administration. Japan occupied Nauru during World War II and used its residents as forced labor elsewhere in the Pacific while destroying much of the infrastructure on the island. After the war, Nauru became a <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> trust territory under Australian administration.</p>

        <p>Recognizing the phosphate stocks would eventually be depleted, in <time datetime="1962">1962</time>, Australian Prime Minister Robert MENZIES offered to resettle all Nauruans on Curtis Island in Queensland, but Nauruans rejected that plan and opted for independence, which was achieved in <time datetime="1968">1968</time>. In <time datetime="1970">1970</time>, Nauru purchased the phosphate mining assets, and income from the mines made Nauruans among the richest people in the world. However, Nauru subsequently began a series of unwise investments in buildings, musical theater, and an airline.</p>

        <p>Nauru sued Australia in <time datetime="1989">1989</time> for the damage caused by mining when Australia administered the island. Widespread phosphate mining officially ceased in <time datetime="2006">2006</time>.</p>

        <p>Nauru went nearly bankrupt by <time datetime="2000">2000</time> and tried to rebrand itself as an offshore banking haven, although it ended that practice in <time datetime="2005">2005</time>. In <time datetime="2001">2001</time>, Australia set up the Nauru Regional Processing Center (NRPC), an offshore refugee detention facility, paying Nauru per person at the center. The NRPC was closed in <time datetime="2008">2008</time> but reopened in <time datetime="2000">2012</time>.</p>

        <p>The number of refugees has steadily declined since <time datetime="2014">2014</time>, and the remaining people were moved to a hotel in Brisbane, Australia, in <time datetime="2020">2020</time>, effectively shuttering the NRPC. In a bid for Russian humanitarian aid, in <time datetime="2008">2008</time>, Nauru recognized the breakaway Georgian republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.</p>

          <h3>Telecommunication systems</h3>

          <p><strong>general assessment:</strong> relies on satellite as the primary Internet service provider and mobile operator; internet connectivity on the island is very limited and unstable due to the vulnerability of the network infrastructure to bad weather and limited network coverage, with several blind spots (<time datetime="2022">2022</time>)</p>

          <p><strong>domestic:</strong> fixed-line 0 per 100 and mobile-cellular subscribership approximately 92 per 100 (<time datetime="2020">2020</time>)</p>

          <p><strong>international:</strong> country code - 674; satelite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Pacific Ocean)</p>

          <p><strong>note:</strong> the <abbr title="Coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since <time datetime="2020">2020</time>, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward <abbr title="Fifth-Generation">5G</abbr> implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure;</p>
            
          <p><strong>note (continued):</strong> consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</p>
